# This file defines a new tree structure for printing out Coffeequate
# expression nodes.
#
# This is motivated by a desire to keep the representation logic separate from
# the display logic. For example, we want x*y**-1 to be represented as the
# string "x/y" and as the LaTeX "\frac{x}{y}". Notice the logic that puts the
# y on the bottom of the fraction. We don't want to have to write that in both
# the toLaTeX and toString method. So we write a toDrawingNode method for all
# of the expression nodes. In this case, the result of toDrawingNode would be:
#
# new Fraction(new Variable("x"), new Variable("y"))
#
# Then we implement a toLaTeX and toString method for all of the DrawingNodes.
#
# This means that supporting a new output format for pretty printing is easy:
# we just need to implement the toWhatever method on the DrawingNode
# subclasses.
